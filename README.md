# phoneTrackerV1
early prototype of my phone tracker program 

This is an early prototype of my final project for MS548 at The University of Advancing Technology, this program will get your phones location and timezone. In the future I will be adding better tracking and a geograpical map of the area the phone is located at. 

You must include a file that contains your phone number as a variable an example would be:
number = (+15551879333)
